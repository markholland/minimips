  Number of Slice LUTs:                        949 out of   9,112   10%
    Number used as logic:                      947 out of   9,112   10%
      Number using O6 output only:             769
      Number using O5 output only:              27
      Number using O5 and O6:                  151
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      2
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        48 out of   4,556    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,152
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           867 out of   3,152   27%
    Number with an unused LUT:               2,203 out of   3,152   69%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          82 out of   3,152    2%
    Number of unique control sets:             279
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              62 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
